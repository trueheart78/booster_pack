# Booster Pack Layout 🚀

This is the default layout for the Booster Pack setup to enable autoloading
and environment support for ruby apps.

## Goal 🏁

When moving from _"Hey, I have a couple cool scripts"_ and expanding them into a more robust
library, a majority of what's provided should be able to dropped into said project's structure,
and ease the migration to a more fully featured app.

## Bonus 🧪

There is a default `test.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory that will enable GitHub's CI
system, and can easily be altered.

### But Wait, There's More... 💻

Alongside a `bin/setup`, there is a handy dandy `bin/console` that will drop you into a Pry console
with the project loaded.

## Reminder 💡

You're new friend will be `require_relative '../booster_pack'`, instead of calling a litany of
requires.

## Starting Fresh 🌱

This repo is laid how so that, if you want to start a new project from it, everything should
work after you run `bundle install`.
