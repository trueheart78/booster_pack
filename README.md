# Booster Pack Layout

This is the default layout for the Booster Pack setup to enable autoloading
and environment support for ruby apps.

## Goal

When moving from _"Hey, I have a couple cool scripts"_ and expanding them into a more robust
library, a majority of what's provided should be able to dropped into said project's structure.

## Reminder

You're new friend will be `require_relative '../booster_pack', instead of calling a litany of
requires.
